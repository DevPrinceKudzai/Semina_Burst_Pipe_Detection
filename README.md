# Semina Pipe Detection (Project Pipeline)

This is a Project from Semina which seeks to create AIS (Artificical Intelligent Systems) which enables civil and water experts to be able to classify whether there is a pipe burst or not  .The DataSets for this project comes makes use of Data from a selected Bulawayo Surburb which will make use of pressure and maass flowrate values and labels of either they has been a burst pipe or note which is reflected by using ones (1) and zeros (0) (Binary Classification). The Dataset obtained from Samples obtained Bulwayo City Council[The Data is highly experimental].


The project is being developed by DeveloperPrince being guided by Advisory Members who's names shall not be exposed in this documentation.

## Configuration

    The project assumes that you have experience with Python and Basics in ML & NN(Machine Learning and Nueral Networks). It assumes you have basic or an appreciation into statical mathematical computation and Data Science and Mathematics. You should have knowledge in Cancer and its behaviour. 

    NB: Make sure you switch to virtual environment to set the project

    The configurations and setup shall be listed below:

### Install and Setup

    Coming Soon

### Data Data

    Data links shall provided below for the used data sets.


### Contact Details

    The project is for Semina to justify their case and eventually create an entprise solution for clinical implementation. Contact DevelopPrince for more information: +263 716 661 298 /
